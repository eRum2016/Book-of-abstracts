Geo-located points, representing locations of business and other units
can be analysed with regard to agglomeration and concentration patterns,
which in fact indicate a density of region's coverage with the economic
activity. There is plenty of measures on territorially aggregated data
(so called cluster-based measures) and just few on geo-located
individual data (so-called distance-based measures) as SPAG or Ripley's
\(K\). This is to present current possibilities of statistical analysis
of geo-located data in \textbf{R}, as well its applications in regional
science. It would consider the sensitivity of measures for different
spatial patterns. Spatial package \emph{rgeos} allows for treating
points as geometries, what expands significantly the analytical
capabilities. One can also see the neighbourhood relations between
points, which can be applied further in econometric models.
