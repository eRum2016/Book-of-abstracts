Open science needs not only reproducible research but also accessible
final and partial results. During the speech I will present the most
valuable applications of the \emph{archivist} package. The archivist is
an \textbf{R} package for data analysis results management, which helps
in managing, sharing, storing, linking and searching for \textbf{R}
objects. The \emph{archivist} package automatically retrieves the
object's meta-data and creates a rich structure that allows for easy
management of calculated \textbf{R} objects. The \emph{archivist}
package extends the reproducible research paradigm by creating new ways
to retrieve and validate previously calculated objects. These
functionalities also result in a variety of opportunities such as:
sharing \textbf{R} objects within reports/articles by adding hooks to
\textbf{R} objects in table/figure captions; interactive exploration of
object repositories; caching function calls; retrieving object's
pedigree along with information on how the object was created; automated
tracking of performance of models.
